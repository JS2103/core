# TODO(b/118419020): replace copies by upstream versions
# this chart was downloaded by running:
# helm fetch prometheus-community/prometheus-operator --version=x.y.z
# then editing:
# - prometheus-operator/templates/prometheus/rules-1.14/prometheus.yaml
#   to be conditional on .Values.defaultRules.rules.prometheus as well
#
# TODO(rodrigoq): upgrade to a more recent release that doesn't require manual editing.
